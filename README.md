Rebot comes from REcommendation BOT -- a software robot which operates semi-automatically, via recommendations. 

The idea echoes a recent advance in robot building called "social robotics", where robots learn what they have to do by socializing with their human guides.  "Guided learning" is another term for this. 


## Overview 

This project is a collection of parts. Some of the parts are ongoing research projects.  However, there is a reason why Rebot has to be one whole thing -- its practical usecase is ... well ... *too practical* -- the temptation to put it all in one box is just too strong.  

The parts are
 1. Recommendation Engine
 2. Javascript API for Dropbox (does not officially exist) so that webapps can have access to it. 
 3. Visualization components where RING and METROMAP are the two key ones.
 4. A new indexing engine called Stringex -- this one is OK with the index accessed over the network -- say Dropbox.
 5. Chrome Extension which can merge all the above in one package. 
    

Each part is considered separately further on.
